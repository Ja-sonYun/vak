# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## How do I annotate data for use with `vak`?

There are several ways to annotate data.
When we originally developed `vak`, 
we were working with two custom in-house MATLAB-based GUIs.
The first was originally developed
by Evren Tumer in the Brainard lab,
that we are happy to share on request
(please send an email to nicholdav at gmail dot com). 
The second was developed by Yarden Cohen 
and can be found here:
https://github.com/yardencsGitHub/BirdSongBout/tree/master/helpers/GUI.
Additionally, we are adding support for annotation tools
that are commonly used in the bioacoustics and linguistics 
communities: Audacity and Praat.
Support for both is a work in progress 
but we would be very happy to collaborate 
with anyone using these tools,
since they are widely known and 
years of development work have gone into them.

We are well aware that these tools are less than perfect  
for researchers working with animal behavior and bioacoustics data.
We are developing an open-source application 
for annotation and analysis,
tailored to the needs of this research community.
Please feel free to contact the lead developer directly 
if you would like try out early versions of this application 
and guide its development with your feedback:
