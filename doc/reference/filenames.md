# File naming conventions

This page documents naming conventions 
for data files consumed by `vak`: 
audio, annotation, and spectrogram files.
Some of these files may in some cases 
be generated by `vak`, 
but they are different from other files 
in that they are required for any outputs, 
e.g., the files that represent training 
and test datasets and the files 
that represent parameters of trained 
neural network models.

## Audio files

We assume audio files are the raw data 
that all other derived data can be 
traced back to.
For this reason, any filename 
that is valid on the system is valid for `vak`.

## Annotation files

There are two ways that annotation files 
can refer to the files they annotate 
(below, "annotated" files, 
either audio or spectrogram files).
The first is when there is a one-to-one 
relationship; each annotated file 
has a corresponding annotation file.
The second is when a single annotation 
file contains annotations for multiple 
annotated files.

### One annotation file per annotated file
When there is one annotation file 
per annotated file,
we assume that 
all annotation files will contain 
the name of the audio file 
that they annotate.

For example, if you have an audio file named 
"BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav", 
then the annotation file should 
be named "BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav.csv".

This convention makes it possible 
to have other files with the .csv extension 
in the same directory, 
e.g., if you are also extracting 
features from each audio file 
and storing them in a .csv file.
A file named "BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav.csv" 
can coexist with 
"BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.ftr.csv".

This assumption will be relaxed 
after resolving [issue #563](https://github.com/vocalpy/vak/issues/563). 
It will then be possible 
to alternatively name annotation files 
with the "stem" of the annotated file, 
i.e., the part of the filename before 
the extension.
For example, if you have an audio file named 
"BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav", 
then the annotation file could 
be named "BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.csv".

If you are unable to follow 
the current naming convention, 
a workaround is to convert your 
annotations to a single file 
that points to multiple annotated files
using the 
[`'generic-seq'` format](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/seq/generic-seq.html#generic-seq) 
built into our tool for working with annotations
[`crowsetta`](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
as described in the section 
{ref}`howto-user-annot-format-method-2`
on the page 
{ref}`howto-user-annot`.
This is one case 
of "single annotation file, multiple annotated files", 
which is not restricted by a file-naming convention, 
as described in the next section.

### One annotation file, multiple annotated files

When a single annotation file contains 
annotations for multiple files, 
there are no restrictions on the naming 
of the annotation file. 
This is because the annotation file itself 
must contain the name of each file that it 
annotates.
An example of this format is the 
`'generic-seq` format used by `crowsetta`.

(spectrogram-file-naming-convention)=
## Spectrogram file naming convention

As described in {ref}`spect-file-format`, 
the name of each spectrogram file should be the same 
as the name of the audio file it was created from, 
with the extension of the spectrogram file format added.

For example, if you have an audio file named 
"BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav", 
then the annotation file should 
be named "BB_SGP16-1___20160521_214723.wav.npz".
